"""Split documents into overlapping chunks for embedding.

Strategy: sentence-aware greedy packing. We split text into sentences,
then pack them into chunks up to a token budget. Each new chunk seeds
itself with the tail sentences of the previous chunk so cross-chunk
context is preserved (an idea that spans a paragraph boundary still
gets indexed in both neighbors).

Token counts are *estimated* from word counts using the common English
heuristic of ~1.3 tokens per word. The estimate is sufficient for
chunking decisions — being off by 10-20% on a 500-token budget is
inconsequential.

Defaults — chunk_size=500, overlap=50 — chosen for:
  * Enough context per chunk to embed a coherent paragraph of
    engineering prose.
  * Comfortably under bge-small-en-v1.5's 512-token max sequence
    length, so chunks are not silently truncated by the embedding model.
  * ~10% overlap preserves cross-boundary context without bloating
    the index with near-duplicates.

Ported verbatim from project 1 (engineering-rag/src/chunking.py) — the
chunking logic is identical across both projects; per-user isolation is
solved downstream in the vector store, not here.
