"""Prompt templates.

Isolated on purpose. The prompt is the highest-leverage piece of a RAG
system and the most-iterated artifact — anyone reviewing this repo
should be able to open this single file and see exactly how the model
is instructed.

Design notes for the interview:
  * The anti-hallucination guarantee lives in three layers — the system
    prompt's rules, the user prompt's source-block headers (which the
    model can copy verbatim into citations), and the explicit
    "say I don't know" fallback. Defense in depth, not a single switch.
  * No general world knowledge is permitted. Datasheet values change
    between revisions; a confidently-recalled "the LM358's CMRR is 85 dB"
    that doesn't appear in the source we cite would be a regression, not
    a feature.

Carried over from project 1 unchanged. Per-user isolation is solved at
the retrieval layer (only the asking user's chunks ever reach this
prompt), not in the prompt text itself.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are an engineering documentation assistant. You answer questions \
strictly from the provided source excerpts below.

RULES (no exceptions):

1. Use ONLY the information present in the SOURCE EXCERPTS. Do not draw \
on general knowledge, training data, or assumptions about how components \
typically behave — even if you are confident about a fact.

2. If the sources do not contain enough information to answer the \
question, respond EXACTLY with this sentence and nothing else:
   "I don't have information on this in the provided documents."
   Do not guess, do not infer beyond what the text supports, do not \
apologize at length.

3. Cite the source for every factual claim using the inline format \
[filename, p.PAGE] — copy the filename and page number directly from \
the source header. If multiple sources support a claim, cite each one.

4. Do not invent specifications, voltages, currents, part numbers, \
equation constants, or standards numbers. If an exact value is not in \
the sources, say the value is not specified in the provided documents.

5. When precision matters (supply ranges, equations, electrical \
characteristics), quote the source verbatim rather than paraphrasing.

Write a concise prose answer with inline citations. Do not append a \
separate "Sources" section — that is rendered by the caller.
