"""Wrapper around the embedding model.

Backend: local `sentence-transformers` with `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`.
Why local: no external API dependency, zero cost per query, fully offline
inference (matters when the corpus is confidential engineering docs).

Trade-off: bge-small produces 384-dim vectors and is English-only; a
hosted model like voyage-3 would give higher absolute recall and
multilingual support. For this project the autonomy wins.

The model is loaded lazily on first use and held as a module-level
singleton — a single `SentenceTransformer` instance is ~130 MB and
takes 1-2s to initialize, so re-instantiating per call would dominate
query latency.

Ported verbatim from project 1 — embeddings are user-agnostic, so
nothing about per-user isolation changes here.
